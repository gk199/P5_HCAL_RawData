# P5_HCAL_RawData
Code for analyzing raw data from P5 HCAL local runs, with an EDM analyzer for making ntuples, analyzing, and plotting results. Adapted from HCAL PFG code, [Hcal tuple maker](https://github.com/HCALPFG/HcalTupleMaker) and [HCAL tuple analyzer](https://github.com/HCALPFG/HcalTupleAnalyzerExample).

## Runs
HCAL local runs were taken with a LED scan to check the TDC-LUTs loaded in HB. The relevant [Elog](http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/1128105) lists the run numbers of interest and the spacing between LED delays.
